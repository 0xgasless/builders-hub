A stateful precompile **injects state access** through the
PrecompileAccessibleState interface to provide access to the EVM
state including the ability to modify balances and read/write storage.

This way we can provide even more customization of the EVM through
Stateful Precompiles than we can with the original precompile interface!


Precompiles are a shortcut to execute a function implemented by the EVM itself, rather than an actual contract. A precompile is associated with a fixed address defined in the EVM. There is no byte code associated with that address.

When a precompile is called, the EVM checks if the input address is a precompile address, and if so it executes the precompile. Otherwise, it loads the smart contract at the input address and runs it on the EVM interpreter with the specified input data.

A stateful precompile injects state access through the PrecompileAccessibleState interface to provide access to the EVM state including the ability to modify balances and read/write storage.

This way we can provide even more customization of the EVM through Stateful Precompiles than we can with the original precompile interface!
