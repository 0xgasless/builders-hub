When designing your Avalanche L1, you have several options for your native token. Understanding these choices is crucial for building the right tokenomics for your use case.

## Option 1: Custom Native Token

Creating a **custom native token** gives you complete control over your blockchain's gas token. This approach offers several advantages:

### Benefits of Custom Native Tokens

- **Custom Tokenomics**: Design token distribution, inflation, and utility to match your project's needs
- **Business Model Flexibility**: Avoid the high costs of sponsoring transaction fees on other chains

### Use Cases

**Gaming Platforms**: Design tokenomics to incentivize gameplay, reward loyal players, and monetize virtual assets. A valueless native token removes barriers for non-web3 users.

**Financial Institutions**: Enable cheaper transactions compared to traditional banking systems, facilitating real-time payments, cross-border transactions, and micropayments.

## Option 2: Existing ERC20 as Native Token

You can also tie your native token's value to an **existing ERC20 token** (like USDC). This approach offers:

### Benefits of ERC20-Based Native Tokens

- **Price Stability**: Using a stablecoin like USDC ensures predictable gas costs
- **No Token Creation**: Avoid the complexity of creating and managing a new token
- **Familiar Asset**: Users already understand and trust the underlying asset

### How It Works

When transferring ERC20 tokens to become native tokens on an L1:
- The token is **transferred to the L1 via ICTT** (Interchain Token Transfer)
- It gets **converted into the Native Token**
- **Important**: The token loses its ERC20 capabilities on the L1

This is achieved by hard-coding that a native token can only be received by depositing the tied asset into a smart contract. When the native token changes hands (e.g., through transaction fees redistributed to validators), the new owner can redeem the tied asset.

## L1 Native Tokenomics Decision Outline

This **L1 Native Tokenomics** course focuses on implementing and creating an L1 with a **custom native token**. You'll learn how to:

- Create custom token
- Assign Initial Allocation
- Use Wrapped Native Token pre-deployed contract
- Configure Native Minting Rights
- Configure Fee Configuration for Transactions

*Using existing ERC20 tokens** or **another chain's native token** as your L1's native token will be covered in the **Cross-Chain L1 Native** course*.

## Native Token vs Staking Token

It's important to understand that your **native token and staking token don't necessarily have to be the same**:

- **Native Token**: Used for paying transaction fees (gas)
- **Staking Token**: Used for validator rewards and network security

This separation allows for more flexible tokenomics design and can optimize different aspects of your blockchain's economy.
