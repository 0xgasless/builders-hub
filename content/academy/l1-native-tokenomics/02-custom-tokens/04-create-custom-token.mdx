In this course we will be focusing on everything involving the native token creation. The goal of this step is simple: set your blockchain's token name and token symbol. We’ll also guide you through creating a Subnet (required to add a chain) and show the same hosting options you saw in Creating an L1: BuilderHub hosted or self-hosted.

## Token fields to set (keep it minimal)

- **Token Name (Optional)**: Full name of your native token. Defaults to `COIN` if empty. Examples: "Avalanche", "MyChain Token".
- **Token Symbol (Optional)**: Short ticker for your token. Examples: `AVAX`, `COIN`, `MYC`.

## Walkthrough

<Steps>
<Step>

### Create a Subnet

You must have a Subnet before you can add a blockchain. Click the button to create one with your P-Chain address as the owner.

<Step>

### Set Token Name and Symbol, then Create the Chain

Use the tool below. In the Genesis configuration, only set the token name and token symbol for now (you can ignore the other sections). Then create the chain.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
  <CreateChain />
  {/* The tool above includes: Create Subnet → Create Chain with Genesis configuration */}
  {/* For this step, focus solely on Token Name and Token Symbol. */}
  {/* Defaults apply if you leave fields empty (Token Name defaults to COIN). */}
  {/* You can revisit tokenomics details later in this module. */}
  
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
<Step>

### Choose how to run your node

Same options as in Creating an L1:

- **BuilderHub hosted (Managed Testnet L1 Nodes)**: Quickest way to get a node tracking your Subnet.
- **Self-hosted**: Run AvalancheGo yourself via Docker.

You can do either now or later—this course focuses on token creation. Pick what fits your workflow:

#### BuilderHub hosted
<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
  <CreateManagedTestnetNode />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

#### Self-hosted (Docker)
<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
  <AvalancheGoDocker />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>

> Note: The focus of this file is only to set your token symbol and name. You’ll configure other tokenomics (supply, allocation, fees, etc.) in later steps of this module.
