## Overview

0xGasless AgentKit is an SDK that provides on‑chain execution for AI agents, enabling them to sign transactions, interact with smart contracts, swap tokens, deploy contracts, and manage wallets without gas.

Now it supports x402 Payment Protocol which provides 0xGasless x402 Facilitator service with the endpoint ( https://x402.0xgasless.com/ ) for the Avalanche Chain open payment standard. 

It also includes a complete account abstraction stack on ERC-4337 and ERC-7702, allowing developers to build seamless, user-friendly dApps with features like gasless transactions, batching, and session keys.

## What we are offering

0xGasless offering x402 Facilitator for onchin open payment standard and an AI AgentKit enabling gasless smart accounts and autonomous on‑chain AI agents via ERC‑4337, with paymasters, bundlers, and LLM‑ready tools across EVM chains.

## C‑Chain (Avalanche) notes:

- **Native gas token**: AVAX (sponsored mode requires a funded paymaster).
- Many stablecoins (e.g., USDT) use 6 decimals, format amounts correctly.
- Ensure your API key is enabled for 43114 and that your paymaster gas tank is funded.


## Getting Started

## **Use Cases**

Anything can be built using the 0xGasless Account Abstraction SDK. Smart contract wallets are code; any required feature can be written as code.

- **Autonomous Agent Services**: Deploy an AI agent (like a data-eval agent or a code reviewer) that charges other agents via x402 to perform a task, such as fine-tuning a model or verifying a pull request.
- **Monetizing Your APIs**: Automatically charge other users or agents a small fee (e.g., $0.001) every time they call an API endpoint you've deployed.
- **Pay-Per-Query Dashboards**: Build and host a DeFi savings dashboard or an analytics tool that charges users a micro-payment for each new query or data refresh.
- **AI Agents**: Streamline payment processes with smart accounts. Account abstraction provides a secure infrastructure for agents interacting with money.
- **DeFi Applications**: Improve accessibility and usability with gasless transactions and easy onboarding.
- **Enterprise Applications**: Manage complex access controls and transaction rules with scalable, secure integrations.
- **Crypto Wallets**: Develop secure and flexible wallets leveraging smart accounts for enhanced security, usability, and gasless transactions.
- **Digital Identity Management**: Manage digital identities with customizable transaction and access rules for secure, scalable identity.
- **Blockchain Games**: Provide seamless onboarding using social logins to manage in‑game assets and progress.
- **NFT Marketplaces**: Let users interact with platforms using their existing social accounts to improve acquisition and engagement.


## Conclusion

0xGasless stands as an advanced blockchain infrastructure platform with a primary emphasis on enhancing user experience through account abstraction. Leveraging ERC-4337 & ERC-7702 0xGasless delivers a smart contract wallet solution, streamlining transactions and wallet management. This fosters a smoother interaction with decentralized applications (dApps), mitigating the usual complexity associated with Web3. Its modular SDK improves UX (gasless or token‑gas), security (programmable policies), and developer velocity (pluggable components) across dapps, agents, games, DeFi, and enterprises qand now it is also supporting x402 payment protocol which brings x402 facilitator for the AVALANCHE Chain open payment standard. On Avalanche C‑Chain and beyond, 0xGasless helps teams ship seamless, scalable, and secure web3 experiences.
